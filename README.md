# Blockchain Presentation

This project aims to present the basics of RSA and SHA-256 to motivate and introduce Blockchain.


## File Descriptions
Python implementation of SHA-256 algorithm to demonstrate the properties of cryptographic hash functions is presented under [Blockchain.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Atakan-Topaloglu/Blockchain-Presentation/blob/master/Blockchain.ipynb).

[RSA_Demo](https://github.com/Atakan-Topaloglu/Blockchain-Presentation/tree/master/RSA_Demo) along with the rest of the .py files demonstrate how a plain public and private key exchange functions
by allowing users to interactively encode and decode information using public and private keys while also shedding light on modular exponentiation, modular multiplicative inverse, and totient function to provide insight into the working mechanism of RSA.
